This module focuses on problem-solving, logic building, recursion, and algorithms.

⸻

1. Searching Algorithms
	•	Linear Search → checks each element one by one.
	•	Binary Search → only works on sorted arrays, repeatedly splits in half.
	•	Shows efficiency differences between the two.

⸻

2. Sorting Algorithms
	•	Bubble Sort → swaps adjacent elements until sorted.
	•	Selection Sort → finds minimum each pass and puts it at the front.
	•	Insertion Sort → builds sorted list one element at a time.
	•	Demonstrates basic comparison-based sorting.

⸻

3. Recursion Examples
	•	Factorial(n) = n × (n-1) × … × 1.
	•	Fibonacci(n) = sum of two previous terms.
	•	Both demonstrate recursive function calls.

⸻

4. Tower of Hanoi
	•	Classic recursive puzzle: move n disks from source → target using auxiliary.
	•	Each step breaks into smaller subproblems.
	•	Demonstrates recursion depth and problem decomposition.

⸻

5. Mini Project: Flashcard Quiz App
	•	Stores Q/A pairs in a dictionary.
	•	Shuffles them randomly with random.shuffle.
	•	Tracks score based on correct answers.
	•	Demonstrates:
	•	Data structures (dict, list)
	•	Randomization
	•	User interaction with feedback

⸻

6. Main Menu
	•	Interactive menu ties all tasks together.
	•	Lets user try searching, sorting, recursion, Tower of Hanoi, and the quiz.
	•	Program runs until user selects Exit.

⸻

✅ This project combines core algorithms + recursion + problem-solving into one file, capped off with a fun Flashcard Quiz mini project.
